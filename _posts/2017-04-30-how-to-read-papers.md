## How to read papers

This is not something I wrote, but is something a good friend of mine linked on social media.
It is probably one of the most useful skills a researcher can develop. I have, over time, 
managed to arrive at a very similar place as the original author whos paper you can find here:
[Link to original Paper by S. Keshev](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf)

The paper is well laid out, easy to follow and makes a rediculous amount of sense. It is also short and to the point. Follow the steps, there are like... three? Don't skip any. Repeatition... repetition... repetition...

I am planning on revising my own technique a bit after reading this as there is always room for improvement.
