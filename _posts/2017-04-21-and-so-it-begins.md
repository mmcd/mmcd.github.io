## So I have this theory that if I actually make an effort to do this I will actually make a sizeable dent in it and accomplish something interesting instead of talking about it all the time.

I don't know if it will work this time. I have tried before. But I think it may work this time since I am using githubs unlimited priviate .edu repos for all my research. I want to opensource a lot of that and in the process of writing it up and publishing it. We also have a group lab site that I/we are supposed to be maintaining that keeps getting pushed to the bottom of the to-do list. Maybe this will help with that too. It's using a full CMS that is just overkill for what we use it for anyway.

### I am going to just leave the example posts in place for now in the theme.

Maybe its lazy, but I am not at all familiar with markdown. I am just going to leave them there for now. it may annoy other people but this is mostly for me.

#### random syntax highlighting test
```javascript
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

```python
def main():
	print(blah)
```

```c
int main(int arc, char**argv) {
	prinf("blah\n");
	exit(0);
	}
```
