   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-read-papers&quot;&gt;How to read papers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not something I wrote, but is something a good friend of mine linked on social media.
It is probably one of the most useful skills a researcher can develop. I have, over time, 
managed to arrive at a very similar place as the original author whos paper you can find here:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf&quot;&gt;Link to original Paper by S. Keshev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is well laid out, easy to follow and makes a rediculous amount of sense. It is also short and to the point. Follow the steps, there are like… three? Don’t skip any. Repeatition… repetition… repetition…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning on revising my own technique a bit after reading this as there is always room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>redirect and capture stdout</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothing-really-new-to-see-here&quot;&gt;Nothing really new to see here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find versions of this all over the internet, I am just tired of not saving my own hacks and fixes in easy to find ways. This basically redirects stdout to something else, saves it, then puts stdout back. allowing me to capture output and fix something I shouldn’t have had to fix because the sample code for the class (not the Professor’s fault) is completely undocumented and wierd. It basically let me drop prefixes on a toy java database because the way you pulled tables created copies instead of clones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;        ByteArrayOutputStream bstream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        PrintStream pstream = new PrintStream(bstream);
        PrintStream stock = System.out;
        System.setOut(pstream);
        dbengine.displaySchema();
        System.out.flush();
        System.setOut(stock);
        String HACK = &quot;&quot;;
        try {
            HACK = new String(bstream.toByteArray(), &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
        } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        // System.out.println(HACK);
        ArrayList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; prefix = new ArrayList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;();
        String[] tmp = HACK.split(&quot;\\n&quot;);
        for(String t : tmp) {
            if(t.contains(&quot;(&quot;)) 
                prefix.add(t.split(&quot;\\(&quot;)[0]);
        }
        for(String p : prefix) {
            Relation r = dbengine.getRelation(p);
            r.prefixColumnNames(p);
        }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>So, maybe this will work this this attempt</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-i-have-this-theory-that-if-i-actually-make-an-effort-to-do-this-i-will-actually-make-a-sizeable-dent-in-it-and-accomplish-something-interesting-instead-of-talking-about-it-all-the-time&quot;&gt;So I have this theory that if I actually make an effort to do this I will actually make a sizeable dent in it and accomplish something interesting instead of talking about it all the time.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it will work this time. I have tried before. But I think it may work this time since I am using githubs unlimited priviate .edu repos for all my research. I want to opensource a lot of that and in the process of writing it up and publishing it. We also have a group lab site that I/we are supposed to be maintaining that keeps getting pushed to the bottom of the to-do list. Maybe this will help with that too. It’s using a full CMS that is just overkill for what we use it for anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-code-examples-i-am-lazy-and-may-need-a-quick-refernece-later&quot;&gt;some code examples. I am lazy and may need a quick refernece later.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe its lazy, but I am not at all familiar with markdown. I am just going to leave them there for now. it may annoy other people but this is mostly for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;random-syntax-highlighting-test&quot;&gt;random syntax highlighting test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function test() {
  console.log(&quot;notice the blank line before this function?&quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;def main():
	print(blah)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;int main(int arc, char**argv) {
	prinf(&quot;blah\n&quot;);
	exit(0);
	}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
